           The Jaats took up arms against the Mughal Empire during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Gokula, a Hindu Jaat landlord was among the earliest rebel leaders against the Mughal rule during Aurangzeb's era.The Hindu Jaat kingdom reached its zenith under Maharaja Suraj Mal (1707â€“1763).The community played an important role in the development of the martial Khalsa panth of Sikhism.By the 20th century, the landowning Jaats became an influential group in several parts of North India, including Punjab,Western Uttar Pradesh,Rajasthan,Haryana and Delhi.Over the years, several Jaats abandoned agriculture in favour of urban jobs, and used their dominant economic and political status to claim higher social status.
